  abstract = {Previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of stroke - the second leading cause of death worldwide - were conducted predominantly in populations of European ancestry1,2. Here, in cross-ancestry GWAS meta-analyses of 110,182 patients who have had a stroke (five ancestries, 33% non-European) and 1,503,898 control individuals, we identify association signals for stroke and its subtypes at 89 (61 new) independent loci: 60 in primary inverse-variance-weighted analyses and 29 in secondary meta-regression and multitrait analyses. On the basis of internal cross-ancestry validation and an independent follow-up in 89,084 additional cases of stroke (30% non-European) and 1,013,843 control individuals, 87% of the primary stroke risk loci and 60% of the secondary stroke risk loci were replicated (P < 0.05). Effect sizes were highly correlated across ancestries. Cross-ancestry fine-mapping, in silico mutagenesis analysis3, and transcriptome-wide and proteome-wide association analyses revealed putative causal genes (such as SH3PXD2A and FURIN) and variants (such as at GRK5 and NOS3). Using a three-pronged approach4, we provide genetic evidence for putative drug effects, highlighting F11, KLKB1, PROC, GP1BA, LAMC2 and VCAM1 as possible targets, with drugs already under investigation for stroke for F11 and PROC. A polygenic score integrating cross-ancestry and ancestry-specific stroke GWASs with vascular-risk factor GWASs (integrative polygenic scores) strongly predicted ischaemic stroke in populations of European, East Asian and African ancestry5. Stroke genetic risk scores were predictive of ischaemic stroke independent of clinical risk factors in 52,600 clinical-trial participants with cardiometabolic disease. Our results provide insights to inform biology, reveal potential drug targets and derive genetic risk prediction tools across ancestries.},

  abstract = {Assortative mating (AM) is a pattern characterized by phenotypic similarities between mating partners. Detecting the evidence of AM has been challenging due to the lack of large-scale datasets that include phenotypic data on both partners, especially in populations of non-European ancestries. Gametic phase disequilibrium between trait-associated alleles is a signature of parental AM on a polygenic trait, which can be detected even without partner data. Here, using polygenic scores for 81 traits in the Japanese population using BioBank Japan Project genome-wide association studies data (n = 172,270), we found evidence of AM on the liability to type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease, as well as on dietary habits. In cross-population comparison using United Kingdom Biobank data (n = 337,139) we found shared but heterogeneous impacts of AM between populations.},

  abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a recently-emerged infectious disease that has caused millions of deaths, where comprehensive understanding of disease mechanisms is still unestablished. In particular, studies of gene expression dynamics and regulation landscape in COVID-19 infected individuals are limited. Here, we report on a thorough analysis of whole blood RNA-seq data from 465 genotyped samples from the Japan COVID-19 Task Force, including 359 severe and 106 non-severe COVID-19 cases. We discover 1169 putative causal expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) including 34 possible colocalizations with biobank fine-mapping results of hematopoietic traits in a Japanese population, 1549 putative causal splice QTLs (sQTLs; e.g. two independent sQTLs at TOR1AIP1), as well as biologically interpretable trans-eQTL examples (e.g., REST and STING1), all fine-mapped at single variant resolution. We perform differential gene expression analysis to elucidate 198 genes with increased expression in severe COVID-19 cases and enriched for innate immune-related functions. Finally, we evaluate the limited but non-zero effect of COVID-19 phenotype on eQTL discovery, and highlight the presence of COVID-19 severity-interaction eQTLs (ieQTLs; e.g., CLEC4C and MYBL2). Our study provides a comprehensive catalog of whole blood regulatory variants in Japanese, as well as a reference for transcriptional landscapes in response to COVID-19 infection.},

  abstract = {Identifying the host genetic factors underlying severe COVID-19 is an emerging challenge1-5. Here we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) involving 2,393 cases of COVID-19 in a cohort of Japanese individuals collected during the initial waves of the pandemic, with 3,289 unaffected controls. We identified a variant on chromosome 5 at 5q35 (rs60200309-A), close to the dedicator of cytokinesis 2 gene (DOCK2), which was associated with severe COVID-19 in patients less than 65 years of age. This risk allele was prevalent in East Asian individuals but rare in Europeans, highlighting the value of genome-wide association studies in non-European populations. RNA-sequencing analysis of 473 bulk peripheral blood samples identified decreased expression of DOCK2 associated with the risk allele in these younger patients. DOCK2 expression was suppressed in patients with severe cases of COVID-19. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis (n = 61 individuals) identified cell-type-specific downregulation of DOCK2 and a COVID-19-specific decreasing effect of the risk allele on DOCK2 expression in non-classical monocytes. Immunohistochemistry of lung specimens from patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia showed suppressed DOCK2 expression. Moreover, inhibition of DOCK2 function with CPYPP increased the severity of pneumonia in a Syrian hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by weight loss, lung oedema, enhanced viral loads, impaired macrophage recruitment and dysregulated type I interferon responses. We conclude that DOCK2 has an important role in the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the development of severe COVID-19, and could be further explored as a potential biomarker and/or therapeutic target.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Autoimmune and allergic diseases are outcomes of the dysregulation of the immune system. Our study aimed to elucidate differences or shared components in genetic backgrounds between autoimmune and allergic diseases.
METHODS: We estimated genetic correlation and performed multi-trait and cross-population genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of six immune-related diseases: rheumatoid arthritis, Graves' disease, type 1 diabetes for autoimmune diseases and asthma, atopic dermatitis and pollinosis for allergic diseases. By integrating large-scale biobank resources (Biobank Japan and UK biobank), our study included 105,721 cases and 433,663 controls. Newly identified variants were evaluated in 21,778 cases and 712,767 controls for two additional autoimmune diseases: psoriasis and systemic lupus erythematosus. We performed enrichment analyses of cell types and biological pathways to highlight shared and distinct perspectives.
RESULTS: Autoimmune and allergic diseases were not only mutually classified based on genetic backgrounds but also they had multiple positive genetic correlations beyond the classifications. Multi-trait GWAS meta-analysis newly identified six allergic disease-associated loci. We identified four loci shared between the six autoimmune and allergic diseases (rs10803431 at PRDM2, OR=1.07, p=2.3×10-8, rs2053062 at G3BP1, OR=0.90, p=2.9×10-8, rs2210366 at HBS1L, OR=1.07, p=2.5×10-8 in Japanese and rs4529910 at POU2AF1, OR=0.96, p=1.9×10-10 across ancestries). Associations of rs10803431 and rs4529910 were confirmed at the two additional autoimmune diseases. Enrichment analysis demonstrated link to T cells, natural killer cells and various cytokine signals, including innate immune pathways.
CONCLUSION: Our multi-trait and cross-population study should elucidate complex pathogenesis shared components across autoimmune and allergic diseases.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Non-European populations are under-represented in genetics studies, hindering clinical implementation of breast cancer polygenic risk scores (PRSs). We aimed to develop PRSs using the largest available studies of Asian ancestry and to assess the transferability of PRS across ethnic subgroups.
METHODS: The development data set comprised 138,309 women from 17 case-control studies. PRSs were generated using a clumping and thresholding method, lasso penalized regression, an Empirical Bayes approach, a Bayesian polygenic prediction approach, or linear combinations of multiple PRSs. These PRSs were evaluated in 89,898 women from 3 prospective studies (1592 incident cases).
RESULTS: The best performing PRS (genome-wide set of single-nucleotide variations [formerly single-nucleotide polymorphism]) had a hazard ratio per unit SD of 1.62 (95% CI = 1.46-1.80) and an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.635 (95% CI = 0.622-0.649). Combined Asian and European PRSs (333 single-nucleotide variations) had a hazard ratio per SD of 1.53 (95% CI = 1.37-1.71) and an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.621 (95% CI = 0.608-0.635). The distribution of the latter PRS was different across ethnic subgroups, confirming the importance of population-specific calibration for valid estimation of breast cancer risk.
CONCLUSION: PRSs developed in this study, from association data from multiple ancestries, can enhance risk stratification for women of Asian ancestry.},

  abstract = {Although transcriptome alteration is an essential driver of carcinogenesis, the effects of chromosomal structural alterations on the cancer transcriptome are not yet fully understood. Short-read transcript sequencing has prevented researchers from directly exploring full-length transcripts, forcing them to focus on individual splice sites. Here, we develop a pipeline for Multi-Sample long-read Transcriptome Assembly (MuSTA), which enables construction of a transcriptome from long-read sequence data. Using the constructed transcriptome as a reference, we analyze RNA extracted from 22 clinical breast cancer specimens. We identify a comprehensive set of subtype-specific and differentially used isoforms, which extended our knowledge of isoform regulation to unannotated isoforms including a short form TNS3. We also find that the exon-intron structure of fusion transcripts depends on their genomic context, and we identify double-hop fusion transcripts that are transcribed from complex structural rearrangements. For example, a double-hop fusion results in aberrant expression of an endogenous retroviral gene, ERVFRD-1, which is normally expressed exclusively in placenta and is thought to protect fetus from maternal rejection; expression is elevated in several TCGA samples with ERVFRD-1 fusions. Our analyses provide direct evidence that full-length transcript sequencing of clinical samples can add to our understanding of cancer biology and genomics in general.},

  abstract = {The silencing of tumor suppressor genes by promoter CpG island (CGI) methylation is an important cause of oncogenesis. Silencing of MLH1 and BRCA1, two examples of oncogenic events, results from promoter CGI methylation. Interestingly, both MLH1 and BRCA1 have a divergent promoter, from which another gene on the opposite strand is also transcribed. Although studies have shown that divergent transcription is an important factor in transcriptional regulation, little is known about its implication in aberrant promoter methylation in cancer. In this study, we analyzed the methylation status of CGI in divergent promoters using a recently enriched transcriptome database. We measured the extent of CGI methylation in 119 colorectal cancer (CRC) clinical samples (65 microsatellite instability high [MSI-H] CRC with CGI methylator phenotype, 28 MSI-H CRC without CGI methylator phenotype and 26 microsatellite stable CRC) and 21 normal colorectal tissues using Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. We found that CGI within divergent promoters are less frequently methylated than CGI within unidirectional promoters in normal cells. In the genome of CRC cells, CGI within unidirectional promoters are more vulnerable to aberrant methylation than CGI within divergent promoters. In addition, we identified three DNA sequence motifs that correlate with methylated CGI. We also showed that methylated CGI are associated with genes whose expression is low in normal cells. Thus, we here provide fundamental observations regarding the methylation of divergent promoters that are essential for the understanding of carcinogenesis and development of cancer prevention strategies.},
